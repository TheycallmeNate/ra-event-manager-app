# Event Manager App

Create an event management app with which an event manager can:

1. Create new event
2. Fetch all events
3. Fetch a single event
4. Update events
5. Delete events
6. Search for events by category (hint: use req.query)

Each event is required to have (at least) the following fields: (hint: use schema validation)

- title (String)
- cost (Number greater than 0)
- category (business, casual, party, general)

Ensure to use the folder structure used in (or one similar to) the Code Refactor tutorial.

Push your code to GitHub and submit the link to your (publicly accessible) repository.
